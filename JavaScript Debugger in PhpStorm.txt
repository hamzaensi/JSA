1. Install the JetBrains Chrome Extension
To enable debugging, you need to install the JetBrains Chrome extension, which allows PhpStorm to communicate with Chrome.
You can find the extension in the Chrome Web Store.
2. Configure the JavaScript Debugger in PhpStorm
Go to Run > Edit Configurations.
Click on the + button and select JavaScript Debug.
Specify the name of the configuration.
Set the URL of the application you want to debug. For example, http://localhost:3000.
3. Set Breakpoints in Your JavaScript Code
Open your JavaScript file in PhpStorm.
Click in the gutter (left margin) next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear.
4. Start the Debugging Session
Click the Debug button (a bug icon) or press Shift + F9 to start debugging.
This will open Chrome and attach the PhpStorm debugger to it.
5. Inspect and Debug
When the execution hits a breakpoint, PhpStorm will pause the code, and you can inspect variables, call stacks, and more.
You can use features like Step Over (F8), Step Into (F7), Step Out (Shift + F8), and Resume Program (F9) to control the flow of your debugging session.
6. Live Edit (Optional)
PhpStorm also offers a "Live Edit" feature that allows you to see changes immediately in the browser without refreshing.
To enable this, go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Debugger > Live Edit and enable it.
